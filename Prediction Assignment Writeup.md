# Machine Learning Model Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains R code that demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning workflow for predictive modeling. The code includes data preprocessing, the creation of machine learning models, model evaluation, and making predictions on a testing dataset. Three different machine learning algorithms are applied, and their performance is evaluated.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to ensure that you have the following R packages installed. You can install them using the `install.packages` command:

```
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
install.packages("rattle")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("corrplot")
install.packages("e1071")

```

## Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

1- Data Acquisition and Loading

- Training and testing datasets are downloaded from specified URLs if they do not exist locally.
- The datasets are loaded into R using the ``read.csv`` function.

2- Data Partitioning

- The training dataset is divided into a training set and a validation set for model evaluation. This is done using the `createDataPartition` function.

3- Data Preprocessing

- Several data preprocessing steps are performed to prepare the data for modeling:
  - Near-zero variance variables are removed.
  - Variables with mostly missing values are removed.
  - Identification variables are removed.

4- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- A correlation plot is created to visualize the relationships between variables.

5- Random Forest Model

- A random forest model is created using cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- Model performance is evaluated on the validation set.

6- Decision Tree Model

- A decision tree model is created for classification.
- Model performance is evaluated on the validation set.

7- Generalized Boosted Model (GBM)

- A generalized boosted model (GBM) is created with repeated cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- Model performance is evaluated on the validation set.

8- Final Predictions

- The random forest model is used to make predictions on the testing dataset.

## How to Run

To run the code, simply execute the R script in your preferred R environment. Ensure that you have the required packages installed as mentioned in the prerequisites.

## Results and Visualization

The code includes the evaluation of each machine learning model and the generation of confusion matrices. Visualizations are provided to analyze the model performance.
