# Codebook for Machine Learning Model Implementation

This code implements a machine learning workflow for predictive modeling using various algorithms. The code consists of data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation steps. Here's a detailed codebook to help you understand each part of the code:

1- Library Installation and Loading

  - Libraries such as ``knitr``, ``caret``, ``rpart``, ``rpart.plot``, ``rattle``, ``randomForest``, ``corrplot``, and ``e1071`` are installed and loaded for data analysis and modeling.


2- Data Download and Loading

  - The code downloads training and testing datasets from specified URLs and saves them as CSV files locally.

  - The ``read.csv`` function is used to load the training and testing datasets into R.

3- Data Partitioning

  - The training dataset is divided into a training set (``trainSet``) and a validation set (``validationSet``) for model evaluation. This is done using the ``createDataPartition`` function, splitting 70% of the data into the training set and 30% into the validation set.

4- Data Preprocessing

  - This section includes several data preprocessing steps:
    - Near-Zero Variance Variables Removal: Variables with near-zero variance in the training set are identified using ``nearZeroVar``, and those variables are removed from both ``trainSet`` and ``validationSet``.
    - Variables with Mostly Missing Values Removal: Variables in the training set with more than 95% missing values are removed from both sets.
    - Identification Variables Removal: The first five columns (variables) in both sets are removed as they are considered identification variables.

5- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  - A correlation plot (``plotCorrelation``) is created using the ``corrplot`` library to visualize the correlation between variables in the training set.

6- Random Forest Model

  - A random forest model is created using the ``train`` function with cross-validation (``trainControl``) to optimize hyperparameters.
  - The final model is stored in ``modelRF``.

7- Model Evaluation (Random Forest)

  - The random forest model is evaluated on the validation set.
  - Predictions are made on the validation set, and a confusion matrix (confusionMatrixRF) is computed.
  - A plot of the confusion matrix is displayed.

8- Decision Tree Model

  - A decision tree model is created using the ``rpart`` function for classification.
  - The final model is stored in modelDT.

9- Model Evaluation (Decision Tree)

  - The decision tree model is evaluated on the validation set.
  - Predictions are made on the validation set, and a confusion matrix (``confusionMatrixDT``) is computed.
  - A plot of the confusion matrix is displayed.

10- Generalized Boosted Model (GBM)

  - A generalized boosted model (GBM) is created using the ``train`` function with repeated cross-validation (trainControl) for hyperparameter tuning.
  - The final model is stored in modelGBM.

11- Model Evaluation (GBM)
  - The GBM model is evaluated on the validation set.
  - Predictions are made on the validation set, and a confusion matrix (``confusionMatrixGBM``) is computed.
  - A plot of the confusion matrix is displayed.

12- Final Predictions

  - The random forest model (``modelRF``) is used to make predictions on the testing dataset (``testing``).
  - The predicted values are stored in the predict variable.
